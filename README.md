## Disclaimer

Intentionally, for now, Campion is just an app prototype for demonstrating the possibility to build an PWA streaming music player.

Campion allows you to stream tracks that are openly available on each of Bandcamp's sub-domains. Keep in mind that these can be accessed without using any special tools. This however also means that the streaming tracks only come with a low bitrate of 128kbit/s. 

If you want the full quality of a given track, you will have to buy it from Bandcamp as you usually would. Also, if you like a song or album you should probably think about supporting the artist/band.
